## My process

- Wireframe of the design
- Next, started with markup that is the structure of the page.
- styling the for markup
- finally interactive with javaScript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla javaScript for mobile menu

### What I learned

```html 
<body>
  <header>
    some content
  </header>
</body>
```

```css
body {
  font-size: 18px;
}

header {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```
### Continued development

I will continue to focus more on responsive web development using media queries and responsive font size using em and rem. I will like to switch from flexbox to grid for my layout designing because i found out during the course of this project that gird layout would have save me some time if i had implement this project using grid and not flex box. But flexbox this the work though.
